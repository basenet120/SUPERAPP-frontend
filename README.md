# Base OS

Clean rebuild of Base Super App - one module at a time.

## Philosophy

1. **Small pieces** - Build one module, test it, deploy it
2. **Working > Perfect** - Functional software beats architecture diagrams  
3. **Commit often** - No more losing work to git reset
4. **Remote first** - Deploy early so you can access from anywhere
